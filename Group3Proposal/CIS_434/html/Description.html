<h4>Long Distance Difficulties of the Agile Method</h4>

        The purpose of the project is to create a chess board game with a simple but clean UI. The
        board will be in the main window with a side or top bar that describes the movements each
        player makes. There will be two modes: player vs player and player vs computer. The GUI
        will highlight all legal movements for the turn playerâ€™s currently selected chess piece. Given
        this we are aware that we need to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Create a graphical user interface for the board and game menu.</li></p>
        <p><li>Manipulate this interface to change based on certain events.</li></p>
        <p><li>Create the movement set for each peace on the board.</li></p>
        <p><li>Create an AI for someone to play against.</li></p>
        <p><li>Connect the game logic with the board GUI.</li></p>
    </ol>
