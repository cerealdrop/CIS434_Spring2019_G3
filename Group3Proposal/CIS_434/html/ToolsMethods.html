        To accomplish the above tasks, we will need to keep track of what each team member is
        doing. This will be done by using the GitHub. As such, we can use different IDEs such as intellij
        and eclipse for our chosen programming language (JAVA). To create the GUI of the board and
        menu, we will use javaFX or swing; we have yet to decide which library to use but intend to pick
        one at a later date.
    </p>
    <p class="format">
        An overview of how the GUI will function is that the turn player will be able to click on
        any of their movable pieces which highlights the legal movements for that piece. The selected
        piece will be highlighted blue, legal moves are highlighted green, invalid moves because of the
        current board state are marked red, and purple is used to highlight moves that result in taking an
        opponentâ€™s piece. The turn player can then click on the square they wish to move the selected
        piece to or click on the chess piece again to cancel out of their current selection. Such
        functionality enables intuitive move selection for the user and prevents an inexperienced player
        from attempting illegal moves.
    </p>
    <p class="format">
        We will also be implementing a sidebar that displays the previous moves made during the
        game. This allows each player to review how they got to the current game state and potentially
        where they went wrong in their move choice. The sidebar will also allow us to implement a way
        to revert the game state to a previous turn. This is useful for testing move options not previously
        considered until a later point in the game.
    </p>
    <p class="format">
        Aside from this we also have the logic aspect of the game to consider which will be
        bound to the GUI later. The board will be an 8x8 matrix of buttons and chess pieces will be icons
        stored in separate instances of a class that dictates their behavior on the board based on the type
        of chess piece represented by the icon. Such behavior includes the movement of the chess piece
        and special properties for that piece such as en passant and castling.
    </p>
    <p class="format">
        Another possibility would be to have a superclass called ChessPiece with subclasses for
        each type of piece. We have yet to decide on the exact implementation for each chess piece. As
        for the AI, we still need to do a lot of research to even begin implementing it. It is the last thing
        we will do to finalize the project.
